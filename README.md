# PCA_Implementation

This repository contains a principal component analysis (PCA) implementation done with Python and numpy.

### Objectives

The objectives which were achieved are:

* No direct libraries for computing PCA, we only use numpy to do simple matrix-vector calculations.
* Test the implementation on a common PCA test dataset, in this case we used the Iris dataset.
